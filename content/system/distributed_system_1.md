### Fault tolerance

```
### Partitioning
```
Partitioning is dividing the dataset into smaller distinct independent sets; this is used to reduce the impact of dataset growth since each partition is a subset of the data.
```
### Replication
```
Replication is making copies of the same data on multiple machines; this allows more servers to take part in the computation.
